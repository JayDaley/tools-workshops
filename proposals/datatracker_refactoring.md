# Datatracker refactoring

- Current objects: document, group, person, etc
  - Adding an optional 'affiliation' to person
  - Making RFCs a separate document type
- Current interfaces: agenda, submission, etc
  - Possible new interface to find a person
  - Making the agenda interface mobile friendly
  - Possible integration of CodiMD-like interface directly into Datatracker
- Role management
  - Improved role decorators for views (better data-driven access control)
  - Roles for documents similar to roles for groups.
